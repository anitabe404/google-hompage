# Google Homepage Replica
The purpose of this project is to build the [Google.com](http://google.com) homepage.

This is an assignment from The Odin Project [Foundations pathway](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css).

*Note: I will be completing the **Easy Version**, which is more focused on the semantics and layout of the page than functionality.*

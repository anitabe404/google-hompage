# Retrospective
For each project, I like to include a brief reflection on how things went, what I learned and what I'd like to improve.

## What Went Well
There were many times during the project that I felt hopelessly confused. Instead of getting overwhelmed and quitting, I kept going. I identified my weak areas, sought out tutorials to help me improve my understanding, and kept working on the code. Eventually, things started to make sense and I was able to complete the project.

## What Did I Learn?
This project helped me gain a better understanding of CSS and flexbox. In order to complete it, I worked through a good portion of the [W3Schools CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) as well as some flexbox tutorials and guides.

I also learned that simple is not the same as easy. The Google homepage looks really simple, especially in comparison to the typical website. There's not a whole lot of content on the first page. This lulled me into believing that the project would be easy. As you can imagine, I was in for quite the surprise.

## What Would I Change?
There are quite a few things that I would've liked to perfect. However, doing so would've just led to diminishing returns. Still, I am documenting them here in case I do get the chance to come back and make changes.

For the header:
- when hovering over the two icons (i.e. Google Apps & Google Account icons), the highlighting could be more prominent/improved.
- when hovering over the two icons (i.e. Google Apps & Google Account icons), the aria label should be displayed.
- the Google apps icon should be a grid of circles (not squares).

For the form portion:
- the search box should be longer.
- when hovering over the search box, a shadow should appear.
- when selecting the text box within the search field, the highlighting on the text box should be suppressed.
- the search box should be responsive and shrink when the screen width is decreased.
- on hover, the buttons border should be a different color (to more closely match the real Google homepage).

For the footer:
- The margin and padding are a little off from the real Google homepage.
- The leaf is missing from the "Carbon neutral since 2007" link.

Other:
- I don't understand how to use the svg tag. Google uses the svg tag for the icons shown on the page. I used an img tag with png files instead.
- I believe the CSS could be improved so that there's less repetition.
